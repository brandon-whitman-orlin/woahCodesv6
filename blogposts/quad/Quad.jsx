            <h3 className="blog-heading">How it all started</h3>
            <p className="blog-text">
              In undergrad, I found myself working on a group project with some
              classmates I only knew somewhat well at the time. I can't even
              recall the original assignment anymoreâ€”but what I <em>do</em>{" "}
              remember is the energy.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-text">
              There was something different about the way we approached
              problems. Unlike many of our peers, we weren't just trying to meet
              the rubricâ€”we were in it for the challenge and the craft. We cared
              about delivering satisfying, polished solutions. Solving problems
              was genuinely <em>fun</em> for us, and we took it seriously.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-text">
              I still laugh thinking about how we presented that first project
              in full suit and tie. The professor and the rest of the class
              looked at us like we'd lost our mindsâ€”but that became our thing.
              From then on, we worked together whenever we could, and always
              showed up in suits. A little ridiculous? Maybe. But it was part of
              what made us feel like a real team.

              Building the Company Website (The Hard Way)
            </h3>
            <p className="blog-text">
              One of my proudest (and most exhausting) accomplishments during
              this time was building our company website entirely from scratch.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-text">
              It was the largest project I had ever tackled. At the time, I only
              knew the basics: vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks.
              No templating systems. Just raw codeâ€”and a lot of repeated blocks.
              It took months of late nights, endless debugging, and more than a
              few full redesigns (looking at you, Parth ðŸ˜…).
            </p>
            <p className="blog-text">
              The website had to be responsive, stylish, and clearly communicate
              our wide range of services. It was a tough balanceâ€”technical
              content had to be readable and inviting, even to non-technical
              clients. It wasn't perfect, but it taught me more than any
              textbook ever could.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-text">
              This project cemented my love for front-end developmentâ€”and,
              honestly, for computer science in general.

              university FAQs. Its goal was to handle basic advising questions,
              so that human advisors could focus on more complex, individualized
              support. It was one of the most technically complex and rewarding
              builds we did.

              Quad Consultation never officially disbanded. There was no formal
              announcement or shutdownâ€”just four friends slowly pulled in
              different directions after graduation. We all found jobs in the
              tech industry, scattered across companies and cities.

            <p className="blog-text">
              But the energy we shared at Quad? That's still with me. I still
              approach every projectâ€”personal or professionalâ€”with that same
              desire to go above and beyond. To solve problems <em>well</em>,
              not just get them done.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-text">
              As for Quad Consultation's future? I don't know exactly. But if
              the opportunity to reboot it ever came, I'd do it all over again
              in a heartbeat.

              Quad Consultation wasn't just a student side hustle. It was a
